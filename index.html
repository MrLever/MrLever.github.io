                            Master Blaster was a project I made for my AI for Game Programming class. The objective of the 
                            class was to teach us how to make a game from square one, and make it fun. There was no 
                            restriction on engine, genre, mechanics, or scope. It was up to the individual teams to conceive
                            and deliver a fun gameplay experience. I came up with the idea: “What if I just rip-off 
                            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322190/SteamWorld_Heist" target="_blank">SteamWorld Heist</a>", 
                            and my team went along with it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our game turned out to be different from many of our classmate's creations,
                            and it gave us the opportunity to solve some unique problems. Problems like unit control, turn 
                            management, and level generation had huge impact on the feel of our game. Before the game was even playable,
                            those three systems needed to be running smoothly. That high barrier put a lot of pressure on us for the early deadlines 
                            that expected gameplay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project was important to me, and my teammates often looked to me for guidance using Unreal, C++, and Git. 
                            I ended up making or finishing most of the game’s major systems, and I learned a great deal from it. 
                            My work spanned the level generator, player control system, unit system, unit animation, enemy AI, and 
                            most of the game's art. In the <a href="/files/MasterBlasterAI.pdf" target="_blank">AI Design Write-up</a>, 
                            I describe the details, successes and failures of many of these systems.

                            Project Dugong was a project I made for my Processes for Object Oriented Programming 
                            class. The objective of the class was to expose us to working on a software project of 
                            non-trivial scale. It stressed agile methodologies and test-driven development. We were 
                            free to develop any type of project we desired, as long as it was an appropriate amount of 
                            work for the semester. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a team of 5, we decided to aim big. We set out to make a 3D 
                            <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/xcom" target="_blank">XCOM </a> style strategy game. 
                            Instead of a base building mechanic usually present in XCOM games, we wanted to have a simple board game layer similar to 
                            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266510/Hand_of_Fate/" target="_blank">Hand of Fate</a> to control the game's progression. We fell 
                            far short of our initial aspirations, but we learned a great deal about Unreal, Project management, and adjusting scope to meet deadlines.
