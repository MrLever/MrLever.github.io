                        <p>   
                            Master Blaster was a project I made for my AI for Game Programming class. The objective of the 
                            class was to teach us how to make a game from square one, and make it fun. There was no 
                            restriction on engine, genre, mechanics, or scope. It was up to the individual teams to conceive
                            and deliver a fun gameplay experience. I came up with the idea: “What if I just rip-off 
                            <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/322190/SteamWorld_Heist">SteamWorld Heist</a>”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Master Blaster taught me a great deal about what it takes to make a game fun. 
                            Our development was guided by playtests and peer reviews
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our game turned out to be different from many of our classmate's creations,
                            and it gave us the opportunity to solve some unique problems. Problems like unit control, turn 
                            management, and level generation had huge impact on the feel of our game. Before the game was even playable,
                            those three systems needed to be running smoothly, and it put a lot of pressure on us for the early deadlines 
                            that expected gameplay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the project, I made most of the game’s major systems. My work spanned the level
                            generator, player control system, enemy AI, game art, and unit animation. In the
                            <a href="/files/MasterBlasterAI.pdf">AI Design Write-up</a>, 
                            I describe the details, successes and failures of many of these systems.
