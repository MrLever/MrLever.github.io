### Summary
SuperVoid is the first game I've made with the Void Engine. Both SuperVoid and the Void Engine are made from scratch with C++20 and OpenGL.

### Current Features
-   Support for Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad bindings
-   Custom 3D Renderer written with OpenGL 4.5
-   Custom 3D physics engine
-   Flexible Entity-Component system to allow rapid iteration of gameplay entities
-   Type safe event system for communication between engine systems and gameplay entities
-   Powerful framework utility classes that allow
  - Multithreading
  - Resource Allocation/Caching
  - Asynchronous File I/O
  - FNV1a String hashing for fast comparisons

### Planned Features
- Renderer improvements
  - Allow user to select OpenGL or DirectX rendering
  - UI Rendering
  - Text Rendering
- Physics Engine Improvements
  - Separating Axis Theorem collision detection
  - Friction and rotational inertia
- Audio Framework
- Unity/Unreal style editor

### Summary
Computron is a 2D puzzle game developed using Unity. It was developed over the span of 9 months as a project for UCF's Senior Design course with a team of four programmers and two volunteer artists. The game focuses on providing players a gentle introduction to the world of computational thinking and problem solving. We have decided to turn this project back over to UCF's Computer Science department 


## Master Blaster

### Summary
Master Blaster was a project I made for my AI for Game Programming class with a team of two others. The objective of the class was to rapidly prototype and deliver a fun game that featured artificial intelligence in some novel way. There was no restriction on engine, genre, mechanics, or scope. It was up to the individual teams to conceive and deliver a fun gameplay experience. 

Our game turned out to be different from many of our classmate's creations, and it gave us the opportunity to solve some unique problems. Problems like unit control, turn management, and level generation had huge impact on the feel of our game.
